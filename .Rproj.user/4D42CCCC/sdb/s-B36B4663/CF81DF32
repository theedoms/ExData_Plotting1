    "contents" : "## Introduction\n\nThis assignment uses data from\nthe <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/\">UC Irvine Machine\nLearning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning\ndatasets. In particular, we will be using the \"Individual household\nelectric power consumption Data Set\" which I have made available on\nthe course web site:\n\n\n* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href=\"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip\">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]\n\n* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in\none household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost\n4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values\nare available.\n\n\nThe following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken\nfrom\nthe <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption\">UCI\nweb site</a>:\n\n<ol>\n<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>\n<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>\n<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>\n<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>\n<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>\n<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>\n<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>\n<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>\n<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>\n</ol>\n\n## Loading the data\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:\n\n* The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First\ncalculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require\nin memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough\nmemory (most modern computers should be fine).\n\n* We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and\n2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates\nrather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those\ndates.\n\n* You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to\nDate/Time classes in R using the `strptime()` and `as.Date()`\nfunctions.\n\n* Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as `?`.\n\n\n## Making Plots\n\nOur overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage\nvaries over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to\nreconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed\nusing the base plotting system.\n\nFirst you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository:\n[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)\n\n\nFor each plot you should\n\n* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480\npixels and a height of 480 pixels.\n\n* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.\n\n* Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that\nconstructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs\nthe `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading\nthe data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also\ninclude the code that creates the PNG file.\n\n* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository\n\nWhen you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to\nGitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to\ndate. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.\n\n\nThe four plots that you will need to construct are shown below. \n\n\n### Plot 1\n\n\n![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2.png) \n\n\n### Plot 2\n\n![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/unnamed-chunk-3.png) \n\n\n### Plot 3\n\n![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/unnamed-chunk-4.png) \n\n\n### Plot 4\n\n![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figure/unnamed-chunk-5.png) \n\n",
